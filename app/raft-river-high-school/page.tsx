					The first year of secondary schooling at Malta was a ninth grade
					conducted in the year 1921-22. The school board at that time consisted
					of Nap Smith, Orson Sanders and Matthias Udy. Miss Effie Chadwick was
					the only teacher. She was a brilliant person, dedicated and capable.
					Seventeen students were enrolled, i.e., Della Richins, Thera Elison,
					Golden Harper, Rawlins Harper, Horace Harper, Seth Shaw, Byron Shaw,
					Vera Hall, Ella Tweed, Louise, Johns, Stella Johns, Elmer Johns,
					Vivian Udy, Ross Richins, Pearl Taylor, Hilda Nye, and Stella Neddo.

					rock building. Miss Chadwick lived in the home of George and Mabel
					Richins.

				<p>From Bernice Shaw Bailey&apos;s autobiography:</p>
				<div className="ml-8 italic">
					<p>
						“My Sophomore year was in the old two room school that is now the
						hot lunch room (1976) at Raft River High School. Mr. Stinson, our
						Principal, rules with an iron hand. I remember the Halloween that we
						tied a small Jack Ass to his desk. We never gave a thought to what a
						mess and stick the animal would make before morning. The next
						morning we did not have school because we spent the morning cleaning
						up mule mess. (I hope that my grandchildren never read this).
					</p>
					<p>
						May Day was enjoyable for we always took a picnic and hiked west and
						climbed the Twin Peaks on the mountain.
					</p>
					<p>
						My Junior year Mr. D.D. Biggers was our Principal. He was such a
						kind man and had the patience of job. He walked the extra mile with
						every one of us. &apos;He cared&apos;. Miss Albertson was our
						teacher also that year. She was such a refined lady. Do you
						remember, John Albert Peterson, when you were to give your talk in
						Speech Class and you told the Ant Story,
					</p>
					<p>
						&apos;another ant carried another kernel of corn and another ant
						carried another kernel of corn and and another ant carried another
						kernel of corn, etc., etc.&apos;
					</p>
					<p>&apos;Stop John Albert! Stop John Albert!&apos;</p>
					<p>
						He did not stop until his five minutes were up. Those were fun days!
						(Not for Miss Albertson).”

				<p>
					Fall of 1927 found the school still a three-year institution. George
					Neddo had replaced Arthur Pearce on the School Board and there was a
					new Principal, Mr. Dennis D. Biggers, and two new teachers. They were
					Mrs. Phebe Biggers, wife of the Principal, and Miss Alice Gay Nell
					Johnson.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the class of &apos;28, Lano Elison, Floyd Harper, and Lloyd Harper
					went to Rexburg for their Senior year and graduated there in the
					spring of 1928.
				</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>
					Malta High School Juniors, class of &apos;29, were Lorin Horne, Ida
					Barlow, Florence Park, Milton Neddo, Gladys Smith, Lucille Ransom,
					Clifford Smith, Marion Nye, and Myrtle Rasmussen. Sophomores, class of
					&apos;30, were Annabelle Elison, Ray Udy, Katie McGraw, Clifford
					Ransom, Deward Hall, Theo Horne, Rulon Horne, John Lloyd, Lorenzo
					Tracy, parkMartial, Orvis Parish, Edres Glenn, Hannah Jacobsen,
					Charles Horne, and Elizabeth Horne.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Student Body formed an organization this year. Lorin Horne was
					elected President and Katie McGraw Vice President. Lorin prevailed on
					Bishop Sanders of the Malta LDS Ward to raise the ceiling in the
					church hall to make it more useable for basketball. The High School
					had no gymnasium of its own.
				</p>
				<p>
					Miss Johnson, needing a way of knowing the time of day, brought her
					alarm clock and placed it on her desk. It was not many days until
					mischief as only boys can contrive it was planned and carried out.
					Clifford Ransom and Theo Horne thought to relieve the monotony of the
					usual routine and set the alarm to go off in class. Right in the
					middle of a literature lesson the alarm set up a terrific noise. It
					was quickly stifled by the teacher and she scanned the faces of the
					class with eyes blazing. “I don&apos;t believe it was anyone in this
					class,” she stated as her gaze passed over the expressionless faces of
					Clifford and Theo. “They wouldn&apos;t&apos; dare do that.” The boys
					had anticipated this very reasoning and so they obtained full benefit
					from their little “game” by seeing it firsthand with a minimum risk of
					being caught.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beginning in September 1928, Miss Ruth Greene replaced Miss Johnson on
					the faculty. Of the classes of &apos;28 and &apos;29, Lorin Horne,
					Shirley Barlow, Inez Smith, Gladys Smith, Bernice Shaw, Ruth Barlow,
					and Marion Nye went to Albion and took enough classes in high school
					there to graduate while they attended their first year of college at
					the Albion State Normal School.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ida Barlow and Florence Park stayed at Malta taking courses which
					would give them the required credits for graduation. The school was
					not allowed to give diplomas at the time of registration in the fall
					but before the end of the spring semester it became accredited for a
					full four course of study. In the spring of 1929 Inez Smith, Gladys
					Smith, and Bernice Shaw transferred credits from Albion to Malta and
					with Ida Barlow and Florence Park received diplomas from Malta High
					School, the first ever issued by the school. The Senior class for the
					year had been only two students, Florence and Ida, the others having
					been in attendance at Albion. Lorin, Shirley, Ruth, and Marion
					received diplomas from Albion High School.
				</p>
				<p>
					Juniors of the year 1928-29 were Annabelle Elison, Ray Udy, Lorenzon
					Tracy, Rulon Horne, Theo Horne, Deward Hall, Katie McGraw, Hannah
					Jacobsen, and Edres Glenn. Rulon Horne was elected Student Body
					President but he dropped out in October and his brother Theo was
					elected to replace him. Ida Barlow was Vice President and Annabelle
					Elison was Secretary.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was no change in the faculty or school board for the year
					1929-30. The first official Senior Class, class of &apos;30, consisted
					of Ray Udy, Annabelle Elison, Katie McGraw, Theo Horne, and Katherine
					Stearns. Theo Horne was reelected Study Body President after filling
					part of a term the year before. With the help of Asahel McBride&apos;s
					sister, Verda, who had been on a student council in another school,
					Theo wrote a constitution for the Student Body organization. It was
					formally ratified and accepted for future use of the school.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was a year for other notable “firsts”. Malta High School&apos;s
					basketball team played in the State Tournament this year for the first
					time. Henry Belnap was coach. Players were: Centers, Theo Horne and
					Victory Harper; forwards, Lester Tracy, Orville Udy, and Carol Smith;
					guards, Lorenzo Tracy and Deward Hall. Ray Udy, on the bench with an
					injured knee, was acting manager. The tournament was held at Paul. We
					played Albion and Declo, losing to both.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Track Meet was held at Malta this year with Elba students. In the
					440 yard dash, Malta&apos;s participants were Lorenzo Tracy, Ray Udy,
					and Theo Horne. Lorenzo took first place and Theo second. Times were
					not recorded. (We had no stop-watch).
